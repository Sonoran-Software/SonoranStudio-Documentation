# Stream Automations

Stream Automations connect live Sonoran CAD, Radio, FiveM, and LSPDFR activity to actions in [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot/). A panic can switch an OBS scene, drawing a weapon can play an animation, or a dispatch update can send a chat message without creating a separate integration.

{% hint style="info" %}
Stream Automations require the [Pro version of Sonoran Studio](pricing.md), the Sonoran Studio desktop app, and Streamer.bot running on the same computer.
{% endhint %}

## How it works

1. The Studio desktop app receives realtime CAD and Radio events plus native-backed gameplay moments from the FiveM or LSPDFR integration.
2. Studio converts a supported event into a Stream Automation event.
3. If that event has a mapped Streamer.bot action, Studio invokes the action through Streamer.bot's local WebSocket server.
4. Studio includes the event name and any available unit, call, channel, location, priority, or panic data as action arguments.

An event mapped to **Do nothing** does not invoke Streamer.bot. Automations run locally, so both desktop applications must remain open.

## Set up Streamer.bot

### 1. Create an action

In Streamer.bot, create the action you want Studio to run. Add sub-actions such as changing an OBS scene, playing audio, showing a source, or sending a chat message. Make sure the action is enabled.

### 2. Start the WebSocket server

In Streamer.bot, open **Servers/Clients → WebSocket Server** and start the server. The defaults are:

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Address | `127.0.0.1` |
| Port | `8080` |
| Endpoint | `/` |
| Authentication | Off |

Enable **Auto Start** if the server should start with Streamer.bot. If authentication is enabled and enforced, enter the same password in Sonoran Studio. See Streamer.bot's [WebSocket server configuration](https://docs.streamer.bot/api/websocket/guide/configuration) for more detail.

### 3. Connect Sonoran Studio

1. Open the Sonoran Studio desktop app and select **Bot**.
2. Enter the WebSocket **Port** and **Endpoint**. Enter the password only if Streamer.bot requires one.
3. Select **Save & connect**.
4. Confirm that Studio reports **Connected** and loads your enabled Streamer.bot actions.

Studio only connects to Streamer.bot on the local computer. The password and event mappings are stored locally.

### 4. Map and test events

Choose a Streamer.bot action beside each Sonoran event. Select **Test** to invoke that mapping immediately. A test supplies `sonoranEvent`, `test`, `occurredAt`, and the title `Sonoran Studio test`; live event-specific data appears only when the corresponding event actually occurs.

## Supported events

| Sonoran event | When it runs | Event value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Radio starts | A radio transmission begins | `radio.started` |
| Radio ends | The active radio transmission finishes | `radio.ended` |
| Unit status | Your CAD unit receives a status update | `unit.status` |
| Call attached | You attach to a different CAD call | `call.attached` |
| Call changed | The active call updates, or you detach from it | `call.changed` |
| Call note | A dispatch notification is identified as a call note | `call.note` |
| Dispatch update | Any other CAD dispatch notification arrives | `dispatch.notification` |
| Panic starts | A panic visible to your Studio overlay activates | `panic.started` |
| Panic ends | That visible panic clears | `panic.ended` |
| Weapon drawn | The player changes from unarmed to armed | `game.weapon.drawn` |
| Weapon holstered | The player changes from armed to unarmed | `game.weapon.holstered` |
| Player died | The player entity changes to dead | `game.player.died` |
| Player revived | The player entity changes from dead to alive after a respawn or revive | `game.player.returned` |
| Travel on foot | The player leaves a vehicle | `game.travel.on_foot` |
| Travel in vehicle | The player enters a non-air/non-water vehicle class | `game.travel.vehicle` |
| Travel by aircraft | The player enters a helicopter or plane | `game.travel.aircraft` |
| Travel by watercraft | The player enters a boat | `game.travel.watercraft` |
| Health lower than | Usable health crosses below your configured percentage | `game.health.low` |
| Health higher than | After low health, usable health crosses above your configured percentage | `game.health.recovered` |

Channel-only changes do not currently invoke a separate automation event. Call updates use **Call changed**, and call-note notifications use **Call note**.

Gameplay moments are available from either the [standalone or Sonoran CAD FiveM integration](smart-lighting.md#fivem) and from the [LSPDFR integration](smart-lighting.md#lspdfr). Set the two health limits directly beside their Streamer.bot mappings or in the Smart Device scene builder's **Health threshold** event; the defaults are 35% and 50%, and the same limits drive lighting and Streamer.bot. **Player revived** combines respawns and revives because GTA natives expose the dead-to-alive transition, not the recovery system that caused it.

## Action arguments

Every live action receives these arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sonoranEvent` | The mapped event value shown above |
| `occurredAt` | ISO timestamp recorded by Studio |

CAD and Radio actions also receive `sonoranSourceEvent`, the original Studio event such as `cad.panic.changed`, and `eventId`, its unique realtime event ID.

Gameplay actions receive `sonoranSource` as `fivem` or `lspdfr`. Depending on the moment, they can include `weaponHash`, `health`, `maximumHealth`, `healthPercent`, `healthLowerThan`, `healthHigherThan`, `travelMode`, `vehicleClass`, and `vehicleModel`.

Studio also includes the following values when they are available for the event or current overlay state:

`communityId`, `serverId`, `unit`, `displayName`, `unitNumber`, `department`, `status`, `location`, `postal`, `callsign`, `channel`, `priority`, `callId`, `title`, and `message`.

Panic actions additionally receive:

| Argument | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `panicActive` | `true` for `panic.started`; `false` for `panic.ended` |
| `panicScope` | `self` when the panic belongs to the signed-in account; otherwise `community` |

Call actions can receive `callAttached`: `true` when a call attaches and `false` when it detaches.

Streamer.bot exposes action arguments to sub-actions with `%variable%` syntax. For example, use `%unitNumber%`, `%status%`, or `%sonoranEvent%` in a compatible text field. Open **Actions & Queues → Action History** after a live event to inspect the values supplied to that run.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Optional arguments are omitted when Studio does not have a value. Design actions so missing unit, call, or location data does not cause the automation to fail.
{% endhint %}

## Troubleshooting

### Studio does not connect

* Confirm Streamer.bot is running and its WebSocket server is started.
* Verify the port and endpoint match. The defaults are `8080` and `/`.
* If authentication is enabled, re-enter the matching password in Studio.
* Keep the server address on `127.0.0.1`; Studio intentionally connects only to the local computer.

### An action is missing

Studio loads enabled actions reported by Streamer.bot. Enable the action, then select **Reload actions** in Studio.

### A mapped action does not run

* Confirm Studio shows **Connected** and the event is not set to **Do nothing**.
* Use **Test** beside the mapping. If the test succeeds, wait for the real Sonoran event to inspect its full arguments.
* Check **Actions & Queues → Action History** in Streamer.bot for the action result and supplied arguments.
* CAD and Radio events require the desktop app to be signed into the same Sonoran account and community producing the activity. FiveM and LSPDFR gameplay moments require their local game integration and the Studio desktop app.

## Advanced integrations

Local tools can list or invoke Streamer.bot actions and mapped Sonoran events through the Studio desktop API. See [Developer Documentation](developer-documentation.md#streamerbot-actions).
